# Hogan's Alley

This is clone of the original Hogan's Alley game for Nintendo. I'm using it to learn some game development basics so expect it to be lame and half functional.

Currently there is just an HTML/JavaScript version but ports to other systems may be coming soon. Who knows.

I have no idea how many trademark and patent laws I'm stomping on by reusing the original graphics. Hopefully no one will mind ;)
